For my rails project I decided to create a basic online shopping application. As always, my initial hopes for this project were much larger than time allowed and it ended up as half of the application I really intended to build, BUT IT WORKS! That's what counts right? It also leaves me with plenty of room to go back, play with it, add to it, and sharpen my ruby skills in the future. I intend to do this with all of our projects. Nothing is ever "complete" is it? That may be one of my biggest takeaways from this project. One of many.
As I venture down the developers path I am truly beginning to see that coding never ends. Learning about code never ends. Even with as much curriculum as we covered with rails, we barely scratched the surface. RAILS. IS. HUGE.
Rais does SO MUCH without you ever realizing it. Rails writes HTML, Rails writes Ruby, Rails can even write some CSS. It is truly amazing the work being done behind the scenes when it comes to rails. It can be a blessing, and it can also be a curse.
Because rails has so much going on under the hood, without a good understanding of what is happening and why it is easy to get lost in the magic. I found myself constantly googling what HTML a form helper would write, and how to organize my arguments to get the corrct output (collection_select is one I'm STILL looking up every time I use it. It has so many options available!) If I could go back to the beginning of this module, I would surely complete the HTML bonus section before proceeding to rails. I taught myself HTML roughly 5 months ago, and that is what lead me to Flatiron. Having said that, I realized that a lot of that knowledge was burried under ruby, sinatra, and rails. If I had done the HTML Bonus It would have been an excellent review and would have put me in an excellent position to understand exactly what rails was writing for me.
In summary, I currently have a love-hate relationship with Rails. It is a very smooth framework, that has saved countless developers countless hours, but sometimes its almost to smooth. Slippery, if you will, and sometimes when things are slippery we fall. Luckily, many a dev before I have fallen down the rails rabbit holes and there are resources everywhere for rails help. And for those: a huge THANK YOU!!!!!!!!
