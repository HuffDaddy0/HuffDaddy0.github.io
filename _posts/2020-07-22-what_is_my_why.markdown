I decided to learn to code due to Covid-19. I was laid off in March 2020 from my job as an electrician. My father was an electrician and I watched him struggle during the housing crash in 2008. He recovered, however was also laid off due to Covid. I made the decision that I will not live this struggle of layoff after layoff that I have watched him endure through life. My wife and three children depend on me, and i refuse to let them down.
They are my real why.
As an electrician I regularly spent many weeks away from them for work. I missed my youngest son coming home from the NICU because I was gone for work. I refuse to set my personal life on the back-burner in pursuit of a dollar. While I am realistic and understand that software development is not an easy job, it is a path that will see me home much more often. To me, that is the biggest benefit of changing careers.
